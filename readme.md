# Ride Sharing Backend API

## Project Overview

This project is a backend API for a ride-sharing platform, enabling users to register, login, request rides, and drivers to manage ride requests. It supports role-based access control with different roles such as Rider, Driver, and Admin.

Key features include:

- **Geolocation-based driver matching:** Finds the nearest available drivers to the riderâ€™s pickup location using geospatial queries.
- **Fare calculation:** Calculates ride fare dynamically based on the distance between pickup and destination locations.
- User authentication and authorization with JWT tokens (access and refresh tokens).
- User management (create, update, block, unblock, delete).
- Driver registration, approval, suspension, and location updates.
- Ride lifecycle management: request, accept, reject, pick up, transit, complete, cancel.
- Real-time driver availability and earnings tracking.
- Role-based access control enforced via middleware.
- Data validation using schemas.

## Setup & Environment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RAKIBURRAHMAN007/ride-sharing-backEnd
   cd ride-sharing-backend
   ```
````

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

   ```

4. **Run the server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev

## Notes

- All routes requiring authentication use JWT tokens and role checks via `checkAuth` middleware.
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with configurable salt rounds.
- Drivers must be approved by an admin before they can accept rides.
- Ride fares and distances are calculated server-side based on coordinates.
- Proper error handling with HTTP status codes and messages is implemented throughout.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- Zod for request validation
- HTTP status codes package for standardized responses
